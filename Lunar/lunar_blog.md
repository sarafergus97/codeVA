## Classroom Highlights 
This exemplar demonstrates: 
1. Unplugged Data Science
2. No relationship
3. Data Tools like the [hedonometer](https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/?from=2020-11-01&to=2022-04-30)
4. A physical visualization
5. Outliers and consideration of size of data
6. Categorical versus numerical data.

This project attempts to address the aesthetic perspective of [communal meaning](http://www.animatingdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/pictures/AestPersp/pdfs/Aesthetics%20Short%20Take.pdf) by searching for patterns in human behavior that we all demonstrate.


## The Project

This project looks at the [lunar effect](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lunacy-and-the-full-moon/), the idea that human behavior changes when the moon is full. Over the course of about a month, we noted the phase of the moon, the percent illumination, and the "happiness" of New York Times headlines for the day. Happiness was measured by averaging the [hedonometer](https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/?from=2020-11-01&to=2022-04-30) score for each word in the title. 

Two visualizations were created. First, a physical box and whisker plot shows the spread of happiness in each phase of the moon. It appears that there is no substantial pattern. There was not a lot of data in general, but particularly for full and new moons. This is something that we explore in the write up.

The second visualization was a scatterplot showing illumination percent and happiness. It is important to notice that the box-and-whisker was created for moon phase, a categorical variable, and a scatterplot was created for a continuous numerical variable, percent illumination. The scatterplot labels some of the major points (for example, *War in Ukraine* had a much lower happiness score than any other headlines). There appears to be no relationship.

In the write up, we conducted some follow-up research to answer the question of why so many people believe in the "lunar effect", even though we didn't find that it had any effect.
