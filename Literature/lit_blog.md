## Classroom Highlights 
This exemplar demonstrates: 
1. Unplugged Data Science
2. Interactive isualization
3. Interactive *and* adaptive visualization
4. Emerging visualization (map)
5. Data Science in a local context
6. A call-to-action in response to findings

This project attempts to address the aesthetic perspective of [disruption](http://www.animatingdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/pictures/AestPersp/pdfs/Aesthetics%20Short%20Take.pdf) by taking a critical look at required reading curriculum. 


## The Project

This project explores the demographics of common required reading books and their authors. In this case, a list common required reading books were chosen. In reality, a student may use the book list of their own English Department.

Five dimensions were considered: genre and year of publication of the book, and race, gender, and nationality of the author. Author race, author gender, and book genre were visualized as interactive pie charts. When a slice of the pie is lifted, one finds the books/authors in that slice.

The year of publication of the book was considered as an interactive histogram by stacking books according to centry of publication. This allows the visualization to change as changes in curriculum are made, and allows students to physically see and maniputlate the histogram.

Finally, the author's nationailty is visualized with a map.

After the exploratory data analysis was conducted, a new reading list was created in an attempt to diversify the curriculum. To ensure that the new list was balanced, that list was also analyzed in the same way.

In the report and the call to action, the purpose of the current lack of diversity, is considered and some potiential hurdles (for example, teachers would need to make all new resources) are addressed with suggestions. You can check out the whole report here.
