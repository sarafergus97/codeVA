This project is a basic exploratory data analysis in CODAP ([what is CODAP](https://codap.concord.org/about/)?).

## Classroom Highlights 
This exemplar demonstrates: 
1. basic visualizations (scatterplot, histogram, box-and-whisker), 
2. modeling with linear regression,
3. an example of an "emerging visualization" (a geographic map)

4. an example of "follow-up thinking",
5. the use of [Measure of America](https://measureofamerica.org/) as a source of data,
6. a null result.

This project attempts to address the aesthetic perspective of [disruption](http://www.animatingdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/pictures/AestPersp/pdfs/Aesthetics%20Short%20Take.pdf) by providing insight on a topic that many Virginians do not know a lot about. 

Many students will choose to explore relationships that do not actually exist (sometimes, this will be painfully clear to you before your student even starts). This example helps to communicate to students that a weak realationships still provide insight and inquiry, and that they should not be afraid to investigate ideas they do not already know about. 

## The Project

The project itself explores labor unions using data from the wage data of [Measure of America](https://measureofamerica.org/). It explores the relationships between a states percent of union participation and other measures of well-being. It found that, at an initial exploratory analysis phase, weak relationships ($r^2$ between $.2$ and $.4$) exist between union participation and four measures: minimum wage, state GDP, public assistance expenditure, and median earnings. Two follow up questions are explored, questioning the role of race and gender in the relationship between unions and median earnings. When broken down by either variable, the $r^2$ values fall below $.2$.

An interesting side question- the spread of earnings by race and gender, is briefly explored in the CODAP document.

In the write up, there is an attempted reconcilition between the lack of concrete findings in this report and the overwhelming research pointing to a realtionship. While confounding variables are discussed and considered, they are not analyzed.
